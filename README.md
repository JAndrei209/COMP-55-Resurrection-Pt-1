#Section 1: Overview

## I will be shortening code in map_graphics and making functions more generalized to improve readability and understanding to both viewers and programmers. The current code in Map graphics contains Hard to Read Code

#Section 2: Pseudocode
## // 1 - extra code in new class
## // 2 - Move code around to make it more organized ( move functions away from function declarations)
## // 3 - make sure graphics stay the same
## // 4 - Add comments to explain Map_graphics purpose and how it works

## Commit 1: Create New Class called default_Graphics.java with Steps written in Pseudo Code
## Commit 2: Moved Functions for Readability; inability to move functions to a different class because addGImage error when not added to local Run file
## Commit 3: Added Comments for fellow programmers to understand how Map_Graphic works
## Commit 4: Moved Music Function to New Class
## Commit 5: New Class fixed.
## Commit 6: Added Pseudocode explaining how specific variables change or are either used or unused when. Removed unused Variable. 

#Section 3: Steps
## 1.) Open Map Graphics
## 2.) Read Comments/ Psuedocode, notice a more compact program. 
## 3.) Go to Map, and press run to make sure code implementation did not affect the functionality of the program.
